<h2>Our Origins</h2>
<p class="para">It all began when our founder, Joe Natana, wanted to treat his elderly german shepard to a well deserved bath. However, he realized there was no option for <em>professional dog grooming</em>
in the Medford Area. Dog groomers did exist, but none that could accomadate his or his dogs needs.<br/> Unfortunately for Joe and his beloved Sparky, Sparky couldn't quite move like he used to, and needed a lot
more attention to ensure his safety and comfort. Joe made it his mission to create a company that not only bathed dogs, but also cared for them. Over 35 years later, Paw Friends Grooming Services is still
loving every chance we get to make your pet's dreams a reality.
